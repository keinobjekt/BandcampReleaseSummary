Terms of Service

Use of the App

bcfeed (“the App”) helps you fetch Bandcamp release emails from your Gmail account, generate a local dashboard, and optionally fetch Bandcamp embeds via a local proxy. By using the App, you agree to these terms.


Account Access

You authorize the App to access Gmail only to read Bandcamp release notifications. You remain responsible for your Google account and must comply with Google’s terms.


Data Handling

All parsed data, caches, and settings are stored locally on your device. The App does not send your data to external servers other than Google (for Gmail access) and Bandcamp (for embed data). The developer does not receive or access your data.

Your Responsibilities

- Use the App in compliance with applicable laws and third‑party terms (e.g., Google/Bandcamp).
- Keep your credentials secure and revoke access if needed.
- Maintain backups; the App is provided “as is.”


No Warranty & Liability

The App is provided without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for any damages arising from use or inability to use the App.


Changes

These terms may be updated; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
